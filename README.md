1. Introduction

In recent years, football events have always maintained a high level of attention on the Internet, and the demand for online ticketing systems for football events has also remained consistently high [1][2]. Therefore, in this project, a Football Ticket Sales System is constructed. The sales system provides a user-friendly interface.
Sellers can create and manage football events in the system, set ticket types and prices, and monitor ticket sales. Buyers can easily browse football event information, register and log in to their personal accounts, manage their account information, select their desired tickets via an interactive map, make online payments, and receive e-tickets.
The Football Ticket Sales System can be accessed at the following URL: https://football-ticket-sales-system.gnetwork.space/?authkey=wkywqj
